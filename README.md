# Datastructures and Algorithms

## WIP: Work In Progress

## What You Can Find Here:

- **Algorithms**: From sorting algorithms to search algorithms - everything has been implemented by me.
- **Data Structures**: You'll find self-developed data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, and more.

## What You Can Do With It:

- **Unit-Tests**: All Algorithms & Datastructures have dedicated tests.
- **Implement It By Your Own**: Delete the implementation and do it by yourself. You can run the tests to check if your implementations are correct.
